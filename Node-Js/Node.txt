Modules(User defined)
    Types of Modules
      1) Local modules 
          - CommonJS module format
          - module-wrapper (IIFE)
          - module-caching
          - patterns for importing and exporting modules in CommonJS and ESM format (.mjs)
          - Importing JSON data and watch modes
      2) Built-in modules (core modules)
          - path (that help to work with file and directory path)
              node: Protocol
                - Makes it perfectly clear that the import is a Node.js builtin module
                - Makes the import identifier a valid absolute URL
                - Avoids conflicts for future Node.js built-in modules 
          - events
          - fs
          - stream
          - http
      3) Third party modules
    ES Modules system (ES Modules ECMAScript Standards , introduce in ES2015)

Types of Callbacks 
	- Synchronous Callbacks
			- A callback which is executed immediately is called a synchronous callback
	- Asynchronous Callbacks
			- A callback that is often used to continue or resume code execution after an asynchronous operation has completed
			- Callbacks are used to delay the execution of a function until a particular time or event has occurred
